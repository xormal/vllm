## Usage

### Scaffolding

Together with Devstral 2, we are releasing **Mistral Vibe**, a CLI tool allowing developers to leverage Devstral capabilities directly in your terminal.
- [Mistral Vibe (recommended)](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe): Learn how to use it [here](#mistral-vibe)

Devstral 2 can also be used with the following scaffoldings:
- [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)
- [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)
- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main)
- [SWE Agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent)

You can use Devstral 2 either through our API or by running locally.

#### Mistral Vibe

The [Mistral Vibe CLI](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe) is a command-line tool designed to help developers leverage Devstral’s capabilities directly from their terminal.

We recommend installing Mistral Vibe using `uv` for faster and more reliable dependency management:
```
uv tool install mistral-vibe
```
You can also run:
```
curl -LsSf https://mistral.ai/vibe/install.sh | sh
```

If you prefer using pip, use:
```
pip install mistral-vibe
```

To launch the CLI, navigate to your project's root directory and simply execute:
```
vibe
```

If this is your first time running Vibe, it will:
- Create a default configuration file at `~/.vibe/config.toml`.
- Prompt you to enter your API key if it's not already configured, follow these [instructions](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/quickstart/#account-setup) to create an Account and get an API key.
- Save your API key to `~/.vibe/.env` for future use.

### Local Deployment

The model can also be deployed with the following libraries, we advise everyone to use the Mistral AI API if the model is subpar with local serving:
- [`vllm (recommended)`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm): See [here](#vllm-recommended)
- [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): See [here](#transformers)

Coming soon:
- [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
- [`ollama`](https://ollama.com/)
- [`lmstudio`](https://lmstudio.ai/)  

> [!Note]
> Current llama.cpp/ollama/lmstudio implementations may not be accurate, we invite developers to test them via the following [prompt tests](#tests).

#### vLLM (recommended)

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary

We recommend using this model with the [vLLM library](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
to implement production-ready inference pipelines.

**_Installation_**

Please make sure to install vLLM nightly:

```
uv pip install -U vllm \
    --torch-backend=auto \
    --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly
```

Alternatively you can also directly use the nightly docker image [vllm/vllm-openai:nightly](https://hub.docker.com/layers/vllm/vllm-openai/nightly/images/sha256-a8cf9f2284a648074d6179e1d9caf74b3183536224bcf518fff73cc2b90dbc2f):

```
docker pull vllm/vllm-openai:nightly
docker run -it vllm/vllm-openai:nightly
```

> [!Warning]
> Make sure that your vllm installation includes [this commit](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/5c213d2899f5a2d439c8d771a0abc156a5412a2b).
> If you do not have this commit included, you will get incorrectly parsed tool calls.

Also make sure to have installed [`mistral_common >= 1.8.6`](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common/releases/tag/v1.8.6).
To check:
```
python -c "import mistral_common; print(mistral_common.__version__)"
```

**_Launch server_**

We recommand that you use Devstral in a server/client setting. 

1. Spin up a server (Responses-ready, Mistral-compatible defaults):

```
vllm serve mistralai/Devstral-2-123B-Instruct-2512 \
  --mistral-compat \
  --api-type openai \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8
```

`--mistral-compat` auto-enables the Mistral tool parser, auto tool-choice, and the bundled Mistral chat template for `/v1/responses` (including `/v1/responses/compact`).


2. To ping the client you can use a simple Python snippet.

```py
import requests
import json
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download


url = "http://<your-server-url>:8000/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer token"}

model = "mistralai/Devstral-2-123B-Instruct-2512"

def load_system_prompt(repo_id: str, filename: str) -> str:
    file_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=repo_id, filename=filename)
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        system_prompt = file.read()
    return system_prompt

SYSTEM_PROMPT = load_system_prompt(model, "CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt")

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "<your-command>",
            },
        ],
    },
]

data = {"model": model, "messages": messages, "temperature": 0.15}

# Devstral 2 supports tool calling. If you want to use tools, follow this:
# tools = [ # Define tools for vLLM
#     {
#         "type": "function",
#         "function": {
#             "name": "git_clone",

#                         "type": "string",
#                         "description": "The url of the git repository",
#                     },
#                 },
#                 "required": ["url"],
#             },
#         },
#     }
# ] 
# data = {"model": model, "messages": messages, "temperature": 0.15, "tools": tools} # Pass tools to payload.

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])

Make sure to install from main:

```sh
uv pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

And run the following code snippet:

```python
from transformers import (
    MistralForCausalLM,
    MistralCommonBackend,
)

model_id = "mistralai/Devstral-2-123B-Instruct-2512"

tokenizer = MistralCommonBackend.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = MistralForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="auto")

SP = """You are operating as and within Mistral Vibe, a CLI coding-agent built by Mistral AI and powered by default by the Devstral family of models. It wraps Mistral's Devstral models to enable natural language interaction with a local codebase. Use the available tools when helpful.

You can:

- Receive user prompts, project context, and files.
- Send responses and emit function calls (e.g., shell commands, code edits).
- Apply patches, run commands, based on user approvals.

Answer the user's request using the relevant tool(s), if they are available. Check that all the required parameters for each tool call are provided or can reasonably be inferred from context. IF there are no relevant tools or there are missing values for required parameters, ask the user to supply these values; otherwise proceed with the tool calls. If the user provides a specific value for a parameter (for example provided in quotes), make sure to use that value EXACTLY. DO NOT make up values for or ask about optional parameters. Carefully analyze descriptive terms in the request as they may indicate required parameter values that should be included even if not explicitly quoted.

Always try your hardest to use the tools to answer the user's request. If you can't use the tools, explain why and ask the user for more information.

Act as an agentic assistant, if a user asks for a long task, break it down and do it step by step.

When you want to commit changes, you will always use the 'git commit' bash command. It will always
be suffixed with a line telling it was generated by Mistral Vibe with the appropriate co-authoring information.
The format you will always uses is the following heredoc.

```bash
git commit -m "<Commit message here>

Generated by Mistral Vibe.
Co-Authored-By: Mistral Vibe <vibe@mistral.ai>"

The people of Eldoria were not just ordinary beings; they were warriors, scientists, and dreamers, all wielding the power of laser sabers.\n\nAmong them was a young warrior named Kael. Kael was not like the others. While his peers trained rigorously to master the art of the laser saber, Kael was more interested in the science behind it. He spent his days in the ancient libraries of Eldoria, deciphering the secrets of the laser sabers and the energy that powered them.\n\nOne day, Kael discovered an old, forgotten text that spoke of a legendary laser saber, the \"Eldoria Star,\" said to be the most powerful weapon in the galaxy. According to the text, the Eldoria Star was hidden in the heart of the planet's core, guarded by an ancient force.\n\nDriven by curiosity and a desire to protect his planet, Kael set out on a perilous journey to find the Eldoria Star. Along the way, he encountered various challenges and made unlikely allies, each with their own unique skills and laser sabers.\n\nThere was Lyra, a cunning thief with a laser saber that could change colors; Zara, a wise old sage who could manipulate energy fields; and Jax, a former enemy turned ally, whose laser saber was as fierce as his spirit.\n\nTogether, they faced the trials set before them, each step bringing them closer to the heart of Eldoria. As they ventured deeper, they uncovered the truth about the Eldoria Star and the ancient force guarding it.\n\nThe ancient force, known as the \"Guardian,\" revealed that the Eldoria Star was not just a weapon, but a source of immense energy that could either save or destroy the galaxy. It was a test of the warriors' hearts and minds.\n\nKael and his allies faced the ultimate challenge, proving their worth and their commitment to protecting the galaxy. In the end, they succeeded, not by wielding the Eldoria Star, but by understanding its true power and using it to restore balance to the galaxy.\n\nWith the Eldoria Star secured and the galaxy at peace, Kael and his allies returned to their lives, forever changed by their journey. Kael continued his studies, now with a deeper understanding of the laser sabers and the energy that powered them.\n\nAnd so, the legend of the Eldoria Star and the warriors who found it became a tale told for generations, a reminder of the power of knowledge, courage, and the unbreakable bond of friendship."

    "tool_calls": [],
    "content": "If you can't use JavaScript and your team dislikes PHP, there are still several robust and modern alternatives for developing a web server. Here are some options, depending on your preferences and requirements:\n\n### 1. **Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI)**\n   - **Why?** Python is a versatile language with excellent web frameworks.\n   - **Frameworks:**\n     - **Flask**: Lightweight and flexible, great for small to medium projects.\n     - **Django**: Full-featured, batteries-included framework for larger applications.\n     - **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance framework for building APIs (supports async).\n   - **Example (Flask):**\n     ```python\n     from flask import Flask\n     app = Flask(__name__)\n\n     @app.route('/')\n     def hello():\n         return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n     if __name__ == '__main__':\n         app.run()\n     ```\n\n### 2. **Ruby (Ruby on Rails or Sinatra)**\n   - **Why?** Ruby is elegant and has great web frameworks.\n   - **Frameworks:**\n     - **Ruby on Rails**: Convention-over-configuration, great for rapid development.\n     - **Sinatra**: Lightweight, similar to Flask.\n   - **Example (Sinatra):**\n     ```ruby\n     require 'sinatra'\n\n     get '/' do\n       \"Hello, World!\"\n     end\n     ```\n\n### 3. **Go (Gin, Echo, or standard `net/http`)**\n   - **Why?** Go is fast, simple, and great for high-performance servers.\n   - **Frameworks:**\n     - **Gin**: Lightweight and fast.\n     - **Echo**: Minimalist and extensible.\n   - **Example (standard `net/http`):**\n     ```go\n     package main\n\n     import (\n         \"fmt\"\n         \"net/http\"\n     )\n\n     func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n         fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Hello, World!\")\n     }\n\n     func main() {\n         http.HandleFunc(\"/\", handler)\n         http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n     }\n     ```\n\n### 4. **Java (Spring Boot, Spark, or Vert.x)**\n   - **Why?** Java is enterprise-grade and has powerful frameworks.\n   - **Frameworks:**\n     - **Spring Boot**: Full-stack framework for building web apps.\n     - **Spark**: Micro-framework for quick development.\n   - **Example (Spark):**\n     ```java\n     import spark.Request;\n     import spark.Response;\n     import static spark.Spark.*;\n\n     public class HelloWorld {\n         public static void main(String[] args) {\n             get(\"/\", (req, res) -> \"Hello, World!\");\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n### 5. **Rust (Actix, Rocket, or Axum)**\n   - **Why?** Rust is fast, safe, and modern.\n   - **Frameworks:**\n     - **Actix**: High-performance async framework.\n     - **Rocket**: Easy-to-use, macro-based.\n   - **Example (Actix):**\n     ```rust\n     use actix_web::{get, App, HttpServer, Responder};\n\n     #[get(\"/\")]\n     async fn hello() -> impl Responder {\n         \"Hello, World!\"\n     }\n\n     #[actix_web::main]\n     async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n         HttpServer::new(|| App::new().service(hello))\n             .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")?\n             .run()\n             .await\n     }\n     ```\n\n### 6. **C# (.NET Core)**\n   - **Why?** .NET Core is cross-platform and high-performance.\n   - **Example (ASP.NET Core):**\n     ```csharp\n     var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n     var app = builder.Build();\n\n     app.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello, World!\");\n\n     app.Run();\n     ```\n\n### 7. **Elixir (Phoenix)**\n   - **Why?** Elixir is great for scalable, fault-tolerant apps.\n   - **Example (Phoenix):**\n     ```elixir\n     defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do\n       use MyAppWeb, :router\n\n       get \"/\", PageController, :index\n     end\n\n     defmodule MyAppWeb.PageController do\n       use MyAppWeb, :controller\n\n       def index(conn, _params) do\n         text(conn, \"Hello, World!\")\n       end\n     end\n     ```\n\n### 8. **Clojure (Ring, Compojure)**\n   - **Why?** Clojure is a functional Lisp for the JVM.\n   - **Example (Compojure):**\n     ```clojure\n     (ns my-app.handler\n       (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]\n                 [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]))\n\n     (defroutes app\n       (GET \"/\" [] \"Hello, World!\"))\n\n     (jetty/run-jetty app {:port 8080})\n     ```\n\n### 9. **Node.js (But without JavaScript?)**\n   - If you *must* use Node.js but can't use JavaScript, you could use:\n     - **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript.\n     - **CoffeeScript**: A cleaner syntax that compiles to JavaScript.\n     - **Deno**: A modern runtime for JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n### 10. **Other Languages**\n   - **Nim**: Fast and expressive (similar to Python).\n   - **Crystal**: Ruby-like syntax but compiled to native code.\n   - **Zig**: Low-level but modern.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- For **quick development**: Python (Flask/Django) or Ruby (Sinatra/Rails).\n- For **high performance**: Go, Rust, or C#.\n- For **scalability**: Elixir (Phoenix) or Java (Spring Boot).\n\nWould you like a deeper dive into any of these?"
